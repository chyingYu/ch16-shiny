# Exercise 3: Shiny widgets

# Load the shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr libraries
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("shiny")

# You will once again be working with the `diamonds` data set provided by ggplot2
# Use dplyr's `sample_n()` function to get a random 3000 rows from the data set
# Store this sample in a variable `diamonds.sample`
diamonds.sample <- sample_n(diamonds, 3000)

# For convenience store the `range()` of values for the `price` and `carat` 
# columns (of the ENTIRE diamonds dataset)

price.range <- range(diamonds$price)
carat.range <- range(diamonds$carat)

# Define a UI using a fluidPage layout


  # Include a `titlePanel` with the title "Diamond Viewer"


  # Include a `sidebarLayout()`


    # The layout's `siderbarPanel()` should have the following control widgets:


      # A sliderInput labeled "Price (in dollars)". This slider should let the 
      # user pick a range between the minimum and maximum price of the entire 
      # diamond data set (e.g., the ranges you stored earlier)


      # A sliderInput labeled "Carats". This slider should let the user pick a 
      # range between the minimum and maximum carats of the entire data set


      # A checkboxInput labeled "Show Trendline". It's default value is TRUE


      # A slectInput labeled "Facet By", with choices "cut", "clarity" and "color"


    # The layout's `mainPanel()` should have the following reactive outputs:


      # A plotOutput showing the 'plot' output (based on the user specifications)


      # Bonus: a dataTableOutput showing a data table of relevant observations


# Define a Server function for the app
#// What are we going to Output?

server <- function(input, ouput){
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
   p <- ggplot(data = diamonds.sample) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity))
   #// We can refer to the p graph 
   #// The last value made if we don't use return will be returned. But be explicit.
   return(p)
  })
  
}

  # Assign a reactive `renderPlot()` function to the outputted 'plot' value


    # This function should take the `diamonds.sample` data set and filter it by 
    # the input price and carat ranges.
    # Hint: use dplyr and multiple `filter()` operations


    # Use the filtered data set to create a ggplot2 scatter plot with the carat 
    # on the x-axis, the price on the y-axis, and color based on the clarity. 
    # Facet the plot based on which feature the user selected to "facet by"
    #   (hint: you can just pass that string directly to `facet_wrap()`)
    # Save your plot as a variable.


    # Finally, if the "trendline" checkbox is selected, you should also include 
    # a geom_smooth geometry (with `se=FALSE`)
    # Hint: use an if statement to see if you need to add more geoms to the plot
    # Be sure and return the completed plot!



  # Bonus: Assign a reactive `renderDataTable()` function to the outputted table
  # You may want to use a `reactive()` variable to avoid needing to filter the 
  # data twice!


# Create a new `shinyApp()` using the above ui and server

shinyApp(ui, server)



## Double Bonus: For fun, can you make a similar browser for the `mpg` data set?
## it makes the bonus data table a lot more useful!
